# CODSOFT-Task_no_3
I've completed my third task with CodSoft Internship. 
Task was to make a Tic Tac Toe Game.
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. 
Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (usually X or O). 
The goal is to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The game is won by the first player to achieve this or ends in a draw if all squares are filled without a winner.
